Adds beams for all types of wood which are missing them in vanilla. Thanks to Ezren and PossiblyBlu3 for making the sprites!

UPDATE 0.6: Added a bunch more beams. Living wood/mahogany beams are crafted at a living loom instead of a sawmill.
UPDATE 0.6.1: Fixed dust particles for bubblegum beams.
UPDATE 0.6.2: Made glow masks much less hacky. Should improve compat.
