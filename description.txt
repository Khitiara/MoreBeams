Adds beams for all types of wood which are missing them in vanilla. Thanks to Ezren and PossiblyBlu3 for making the sprites!

UPDATE 0.3: Added gray brick, stone slab, fancy dynasty wood, and new spooky and regular dynasty wood beams.
The old spooky and dynasty beams can still be obtained by shimmering the new variants.
